- [Extraction of alkali metals](alkali-metals.md) from their salts based on a low temperature catalytic process. (sodium and potassium finished, lithium and caesium on halt).
- [Synthesizing sapphires and rubies.](corundum.md) (on halt)
- [Liquid nitrogen plant](liquid-nitogen.md) via the [Hampson-Linde cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampson%E2%80%93Linde_cycle). (ongoing)
- A [Fusor](fusor.md), a small fusion reactor, sometimes also described as "star in a bottle". (ongoing)
