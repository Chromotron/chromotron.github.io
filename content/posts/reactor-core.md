Reactor chamber
===

The central fusion chamber should be around 10 to 20 centimeters in diameter, some sophisticated setups can also work above and below. It should be made of stainless steel or similar materials to withstand the heat and block the x-rays generated during runs. In particular, aluminium (more permeable to x-rays, but less for neutrons) and glass (can easily break due to uneven heating) are worse choices unless additional measures are carefully taken.

My central piece was acquired together with several more used parts from ebay, After many hours of cleaning and sandblasting in my air hood, it changed from tarnished dirty gray (some pictures at the end) to a nice shiny matt finish.

As the experiences eye can guess, it is cross with four CF-100 and two CF-40 flanges. The central sphere is a bit below 15 cm in diameter.
