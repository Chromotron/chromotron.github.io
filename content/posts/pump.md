Turbopump
===

To greatly improve the vacuum, a secondary pump is used. One of the most prevalent variants, a _turbomolecular pump_ is like a fan on steroids: made from a massive block of metal, wielding hundreds of little blades reminiscent of an airplane turbine, and rotating with supersonic speeds at up to 120,000 rounds per minute (that is 2000 rounds per second!).

They are a work of precision, engineered to bat gas molecules outwards, towards the primary pump. Technically speaking, they are actually compressors, they take gas and compress it into lesser vacuum. This only works if the outlet pressure is already pretty low, some require 1/1,000,000th of atmospheric pressure, adaptions enable modern ones to start as high as 1/100 atm. [See the corresponding Wikipedia article or other sources around the web for further details on the mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbomolecular_pump).

The speeds are so extreme, even a single fingerprint is enough to exert up to dozens of kilograms of centrifugal force! Just like similarly fast rotating centrifuges, they can fail spectacularly; and deadly. [Here is what the aftermath of a failing centrifuge looks like](https://web.mit.edu/charliew/www/centrifuge.html): a massive piece of titanium was ripped apart and made a huge hole into a very thick steel wall (there to contain exactly such events)! If something falls into a turbomolecular pump, the damage to the blades is usually devastating and irrepairable:

Even simple air at normal pressure flowing in can easily kill it:

A factory-new turbomolecular pump costs many thousands of dollars. Luckily, I found an affordable little turbopump: a Varian Turbo-V 70LP, second-hand but supposedly unused. [BILD]

It took some effort, but was also able to buy a cheap but new controller brick for it: [BILD]

Both seem to work fine and have only been used in a few little setups yet. Further tests will follow.


Diffusion pump
===
An alternative solution still in use but falling a little out of favour recently is an _oil diffusion pump_. They work by vaporizing special oils which then stream upwards in a jet and drags remaining gas along. Similar to turbomolecular pumps, they need an already low pressure to begin working. Their failures are usually not as impressive, but comparably expensive.
