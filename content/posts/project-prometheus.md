I've always wanted to build my own serious Fusor since I learnt about the concept many years ago, but never got around to it.

I started seriously working on a Fusor at the end of January 2023. Previously I only owned two bad vacuum pumps: a cheap single stage one from China (gets down to ~500 µbar, i.e. 2000th of atmospheric pressure) and a very worn-down Vacuubrand RD4 (~5 mbar at best, 10 times worse then the other). Despite doing fine for their intended purpose of de-gassing and drying, neither could get close to the kind of vacuum a fusor requires. The final impulse to just build my very own little sun was finding a very decently priced second RD4 in excellent condition, even recently refurbished: first test run after basic cleaning got down to 1.3µbar, hundreds of times better than the others and within the range of fusors.

Dubbed Prometheus after the ancient Greek bringer of fire and knowledge, I set out to acquire the vast knowledge & experience as well as the equipment to make my own little sun a reality. And whhile I expected a lot of work, it was even more; but not worse, as it was and is a fun endeavour.

For those interested, here's a quick list of the absurdities I had to acquire and figure out how to use properly. Links for further explanations of what kind of absurd doom machines some of those are and what I got myself into will be added as they become available:

Vacuum
---

- **Second stage vacuum pump** such as a [turbomolecular] or [diffusion] pump to create even purer vacuum, and faster.
- A serious vacuum chamber doubling as the **reactor core** able to withstand heat and radiation, while also being really tight.
- **Piping**, including **valves** and **gauges** needed to adequately control the flow.

Electricity
---

- Adjustable **high voltage supply** able to output at least 30,000 Volts at several milliamps.
- **Wiring** to keep the voltage contained and limited, including **ballasts** to deal with energy spikes.

Fuel
---

- Reliable source for small but reasonably pure amounts of **deuterium gas**.
- **Gas injector** that, when combined with the vacuum valves, keeps the amount of deuterium at desired levels.

Detectors
---

- **Neutron detector** to verify if fusion is actually happening.
- **Geiger counter** to check for radiation, just in case.

General
---

- The surprisingly vast and deep **knowledge** how all of the above actually works and how to interconnect them into **the actual fusor**.
- Ideally some (semi-)**automatic control** of the system.
- And last but definitely not least, **safety precautions**, especially for the dangerous levels of electricity, potential radiation and all kinds of mechanical hazards.
