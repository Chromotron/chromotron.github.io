Inducing fusion requires, colloquially speaking, smashing atoms together. There are three common ways to make fusion (more) likely:

- Thermal: the higher the temperature, the faster the average particle is moving, thus leading to more and stronger collisions.
- Pressure: denser means less free space, so higher pressure increases the rate; also by thermodynamics, a change in pressure also leads to a proportional increase in heat.
- Inertial: as in particle colliders or crash tests, matter is accelerated onto a collision course at a known destination.

Fusors mostly work by the latter, despite also creating very high temperatures as a side effect. Their average internal pressure is very low, though. All current attempts at sustainable fusion either work at low pressures or only reach high ones at a very small volume for short times.

Accelerating charged particles is accomplished the easiest by them into a sufficiently strong electric field. Atoms are electrically neutral, but removing their electrons turns them into a naked and strongly charged nucleus. Often, as is the case for fusors as well, quite a bit of ionization happens automatically as side-effect of the strong fields, secondary collisions, and resulting high temperature. Hence we are mostly concerned about the final acceleration of ions for now, but additional ion(ization) sources can be arranged.
