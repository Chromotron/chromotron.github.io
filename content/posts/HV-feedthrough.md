A quite large negative voltage of about -30,000 Volts needs to be applied to the gasket inside the reactor chamber to achieve fusion. Hence there is a large difference of electric potentials which in air can arc for multiple centimeters or more. Such an arc effectively acts like a short and would not only cut power to the fusion process, but also damage all kinds of components: whatever is along or the end of it can reach thousands of degrees as in arc welding, while the increased current can damage the transformer or other electric parts. While the [ballast] somewhat mitigates the latter risk, it is hardly enough as the only precaution. An automatic shut-down based on measured current will also be added, but neither solves the demand for a proper way to get all that voltage inside the fusor.

After reading multiple sources, the [forums]() on [fusor.net]() in particular, it was decided that making a high voltage feedthrough from scratch is likely too difficult and dangerous, as a fail during operation can cause huge and costly damages. Hence a ceramically insulated one rated for 30,000 V was ordered online at ~300 â‚¬ and mounted on an adapter that came with the central chamber. A column of transformer oil contained by acrylic and rubber seals was added to other further insulation. It is capped by an acrylic plate mounted by nuts and washers on four threaded bars extending from the flange at the bottom. For stability and safety, a cable gland with strain relief, originally intended for 230 V mains, was affixed with epoxy.
