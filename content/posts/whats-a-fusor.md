One of the coolest physics devices within reach of an amateur at home is the Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor, a "star in a bottle". It aims to invoke ungodly forces onto the building blocks of matter to smash them together so hard, they create different elements and useful particles: the modern realization of the alchemists' dream of transmutation. Unlike larger fusion reactors such as a doughnut-shaped massive [tokamak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak) or a sleekly twisted [stellerator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellarator), they are usually spherical, quite small, don't cost billions of dollars, and do not aim to solve the energy crisis. Instead they strife towards very tight controlled fusion for research and potentially medical purposes.

To reach the enormous speeds and forces nuclear fusion requires, very extreme conditions are needed. Outside laboratories, fusion typically happens at the center of stars like the sun, or when they die or their dead remnants collide, and at similarly extreme conditions such as the beginning of time. Temperature, pressure and collision forces in those events are beyond the imagination of most humans, many _many_ times hotter, denser and stronger than anything most have ever witnessed. For example, the [solar core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_core) has a temperature of around 15,000,000 °C (that's 27,000,000 °Freedom units) at almost seven times the density of osmium (the densest material in Earth), and all that with a pressure of over 250 billion atmospheres. Yet solar fusion is so slow as to only create the same power output as a few light bulbs per cubic meter. The massive energy production of the sun then only results due to its enormous size.

There are multiple attempts to recreate nuclear fusion on Earth, most often as an almost unlimited power source. Using [deuterium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium), [tritium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritium) or [helium-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-3) instead of the ordinary hydrogen of the sun is a must, as only those increase the output per volume to a reasonable range. To achieve sustainable efficient fusion reactors is an enormous engineering task humanity has yet to conquer. Consequently, the only feasible way to fuse atoms at home is in very small amounts. There is absolutely no way to achieve the energies of stars or even the smallest professional research lab oneself. For comparison, the fusion of four quadrillion deuterium atoms is about the same energy as burning a match, while a good fusor would have barely reached this number if it ran since the extinction of the dinosaurs.

The low output does not mean that the task of building a fusor is trivial. Not at all, it involves very high voltages to accelerate ionized atoms to the required speeds. But that is for nothing if they just hit some air almost immediately. Hence a high vacuum, free of pesky other things, is necessary. Also only certain rare materials actually work and need be acquired somehow, for example by [electrolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis) of [heavy water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water). Dangers for the public or neighbours are effectively non-existent, but for the researcher directly besides the running thing they are all but negligible. High voltage in particular can kill before one even notices; yet any produced radiation is so weak to be irrelevant more than a few meters away, even without shielding.
